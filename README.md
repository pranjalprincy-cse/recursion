Recursion progress 

Level 1 

🔸Print numbers 1‒N ascending.

🔸Print numbers N‒1 descending.

🔸Sum of first N natural numbers.

🔸Factorial of N.

🔸Power (a^b) using simple repeated multiplication.

🔸Nth Fibonacci number (inefficient naïve version).

🔸Count digits in an integer.

🔸Sum of digits of an integer.

🔸Reverse an integer (e.g., 1234 → 4321).

🔸Check if a string is a palindrome (case-sensitive).

🔸Find the maximum element in an array of size N.

🔸Print an array in reverse order (no loops).

🔸Find GCD of two numbers (Euclidean algorithm).

🔸Convert decimal to binary string.

🔸Compute nCr (binomial coefficient) using Pascal’s identity.


Level 2-

🔸Print the first N lines of Pascal’s Triangle.

🔸Sum of an arithmetic progression a, a+d, …, N terms.

🔸Tail-recursive factorial (show both head & tail forms).

🔸Count uppercase letters in a string.

🔸Replace all occurrences of a character in a string in-place.

🔸Check if an array is sorted (strictly increasing).

🔸Linear search recursively (return index or –1).

🔸Generate all prefixes of a string.

🔸Generate all suffixes of a string.

🔸Print a 1-to-N “triangle” pattern using only recursion.

🔸Calculate the sum of elements in a 2-D matrix (row × col recursion).

🔸Count ways to climb N stairs taking 1 or 2 steps.

🔸Compute fast exponentiation (O(log b) “divide & conquer”).

🔸Find the first index of a character in a string (left-to-right).

🔸Find the last index of a character in a string (right-to-left recursion).

🔸Remove consecutive duplicate characters (“aaabb” → “ab”).

🔸Print all digits of a number in words (“1 2 3” → “One Two Three”).

🔸Multiply two integers using Russian peasant (recursive halving).

🔸Generate all binary strings of length K.

🔸Generate all valid parentheses strings of length 2 × N (catalan backtracking).
